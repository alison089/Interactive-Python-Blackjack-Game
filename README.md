# Interactive-Python-Blackjack-Game
Blackjack is a classic casino card game, also referred to as “21.” The object of the game is simple – get your hand total to score as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding 21. 

☆ The round starts as the dealer gives out 2 cards to the player face up so you can see the sum of the cards.\n☆ The dealer lays one card face up and one card face down so you nor the dealer can see what the total of their cards are.
☆ The dealer then goes around the table to ask each player whether they want to stick with the 2 cards they have or be dealt an additional card to get closer to 21.
☆ After each player has decided whether to deal their cards, the dealer then reveals their 2nd card to the table.
☆ If the dealer busts, each player wins. If the dealer has the higher hand, the players lose their bets and the dealer wins that round.

Remember, we not actually at a casino right now, so take this Blackjack game as lightheartedly as possible and most importantly, have fun!
